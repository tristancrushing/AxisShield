IFileUploadHandler.php Overview
The IFileUploadHandler interface defines the contract for classes that handle file uploads to cloud storage, specifically tailored for secure backup of camera feed recordings. It emphasizes validation, sanitation, and secure file storage operations, aligning with AxisShield's focus on surveillance data integrity and confidentiality.

Iteration Notes:
- This interface abstraction facilitates the integration of different storage backends and enhances testability by decoupling the file upload logic from specific implementation details.
- It promotes a design that is adaptable, secure, and aligned with modern PHP development practices, ensuring that AxisShield remains at the forefront of surveillance technology and security solutions.
