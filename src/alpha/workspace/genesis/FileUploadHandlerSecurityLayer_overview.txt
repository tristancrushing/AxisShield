FileUploadHandlerSecurityLayer.php Overview
The FileUploadHandlerSecurityLayer class acts as a fortified gateway for handling file uploads within the AxisShield project, significantly enhancing the security measures around the core file upload functionalities provided by the FileUploadHandler class. By implementing additional pre-validation and security checks, this class ensures that only authenticated and verified requests make their way through to the file upload process, thereby bolstering the system's defenses against unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.

Key Features:
- Enhanced Security: Through meticulous verification of security tokens and thorough validation of required parameters (file and bucket), this class ensures a higher degree of security, preventing unauthorized file uploads and data breaches.
- Delegated Processing: Upon successful validation, the FileUploadHandlerSecurityLayer delegates the actual file upload task to the FileUploadHandler class, maintaining a clean separation of concerns and allowing each class to focus on its primary responsibilities.
- Extensible Security Framework: The design allows for the easy addition of further security measures, such as IP whitelisting, rate limiting, and more advanced authentication mechanisms, catering to the evolving security needs of the AxisShield project.

Security Best Practices:
- The class strictly validates the presence and authenticity of the security token in every request, ensuring that uploads cannot proceed without proper authorization.
- By checking for the essential parameters before proceeding with any file upload operation, the system minimizes the risk of injection attacks and other forms of malicious data manipulation.
- Future security enhancements can be seamlessly integrated into the FileUploadHandlerSecurityLayer, allowing the system to adapt to new threats and maintain a robust defense against unauthorized access.

Use Case:
This class is particularly suited for environments where data integrity and security are paramount. It serves as an essential component of the AxisShield project's infrastructure, safeguarding against unauthorized file uploads and ensuring that the system remains resilient in the face of evolving security challenges.

Iteration Notes:
- The initial implementation focuses on integrating fundamental security checks without compromising on usability or performance.
- Future iterations may explore the integration of more sophisticated security measures, such as machine learning-based anomaly detection, to further enhance the system's ability to identify and mitigate potential security threats.
- Continuous evaluation of the security landscape will inform the introduction of additional security layers, ensuring that the FileUploadHandlerSecurityLayer remains a vital component of the AxisShield project's commitment to security and excellence in surveillance data management.
